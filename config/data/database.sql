/* You can also use an installer.php script which gets called one time to execute a SQL script 
/* that creates a database and create the database tables.

/* If you want to take this approach, create config/data/database.sql then copy the following code 
/* plus the previous SQL CREATE statements to create the tables
*/
CREATE DATABASE mydb;

use mydb;
